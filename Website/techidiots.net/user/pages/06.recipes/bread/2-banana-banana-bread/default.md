**INGREDIENTS**  
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour  
2 tsp baking powder  
1/4 tsp baking soda  
1/2 tsp salt (reduce slightly if using salted butter)  
1/3 cup butter (at room temperature )  
2/3 cup white sugar  
2 large eggs (at room temperature)  
1 cup bananas (mashed, about 2 medium, very-ripe bananas )  

**INSTRUCTIONS**  
1. Preheat oven to 350F (not fan-assisted/convection) with rack in centre of oven.  
2. Prepare an 8x4-inch loaf pan by spraying with cooking spray. Set aside.  
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together well the 1 3/4 cups flour,  2 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp salt. Set aside.  
4. In a large bowl with an electric mixer or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the 1/3 cup butter butter (room temperature) and 2/3 cup white sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.  
5. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well between each addition and scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.  ]
6. With mixer on low, add the flour mixture, alternately with the mashed bananas (add 1/3 flour mixture, then 1/2 the bananas, then more flour, then remaining banana, ending with the remaining flour). Mix until well combined, then give it a quick, 15-second beat.  
7. Pour batter into prepared 8x4-inch loaf pan and level top.  
8. Bake in preheated oven for 45-55 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the centre comes out clean. *Start checking the loaf at about 40 minutes. If the top is still quite pale, no need to test. Start testing when the top is cracked and turning golden.  
9. Remove from oven and allow to cool in the pan on a cooling rack for 10 minutes, then remove from the baking pan, gently remove the parchment paper and allow to cool further or completely on a baking rack.  

**NOTES**
*  Recipe can be doubled and divided between and baked in two 8x4 loaf pans.
*  Loaf will keep well, tightly wrapped and stored at room temperature for several days. The loaf can also be frozen up to 2 months.
