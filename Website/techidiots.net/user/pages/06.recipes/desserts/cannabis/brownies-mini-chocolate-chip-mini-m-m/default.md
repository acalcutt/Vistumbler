**INGREDIENTS:**

- 1/2 cup canabutter, however strong is your preference ultimately
- 1/2 cup normal unsalted butter
- 2 cups sugar
- 4 eggs
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract (measure with your heart)
- 2/3 cup superior red cocoa- this makes all the difference, I believe the fat content will be around 22-24%.
- 1 cup of baking flour! Or all purpose… if that’s your thing.
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp baking powder.
- Mini m&amp;ms and mini semi sweet choc chips. (You could do whatever you want, but this is what I think makes them.)
 
**STEPS:**

1. Preheat oven to 350F, make sure to get your pan greased up a bit. I like to use the PAM spray that’s specialized for baking- it smells amazing. I also use a 12 inch by 8 inch pan.
2. Melt both of your butters on low heat. I like to add a bit of the semi sweet chocolate chips at this stage as well and melt them in with my butter.
3. Remove the butter from the heat. Stir in eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract.
4. Beat in your cocoa powder, flour, salt, and baking powder.
5. Fold in your m&amp;ms and choc chips, or whatever else you may put! And then spread batter into your greased pan.
6. Cook for 12 mins, rotate pan and cook for another 12 mins. They will still need a few minutes after this.
7. Keep a very close eye! Take them out when the toothpick is coming out of the middle of the brownies mostly clear. They will continue to cook out of the oven in the hot pan, so it’s better to under-do it by a minute or two as apposed to burning them. Using this technique will help with not burning and keeping those soft delicious brownies!!
