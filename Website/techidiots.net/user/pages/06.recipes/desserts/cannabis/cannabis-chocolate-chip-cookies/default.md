**Ingredients**  
1/2 cup cannabutter or cannamargarine  
1/2 cup brown sugar  
1/4 cup white sugar  
1 extra large egg  
1 tsp vanilla  
1 1/4 cup all purpose flour If you are using quick cannabutter, reduce flour by 1 Tbsp for every 4 grams of dried flower  
1/2 tsp baking soda  
1/4 tsp baking powder  
1/2 tsp salt  
1 cup chocolate chips

3. Add  1 egg and 1 tsp vanilla. Mix well being careful not to over mix.  
4. Mix 1 1/4 cups flour,  1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp baking soda together in a separate bowl. Add to the creamed mixture.  
5. Mix well without over mixing. Add chocolate chips.  
6. Mix 1 cup chocolate chips into the dough by hand until the chocolate chips are evenly distributed throughout the dough.  
7. Using an spoon, divide into 12 equal portions. Roll each portion of dough into a ball, them squish down to  about 3/4″ thick. Space out evenly on 2 parchment lined baking sheets.  
8. Bake each tray separately for 15 minutes at 375° F. Let cookies cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes, then move to cooling rack.

**Notes**  
For Softer Cookies  
For softer cookies, you can use cannashortening instead of margarine or butter. Also, cake and pastry flour can be used instead of all purpose flour for added softness.  
 
For Chewy Cookies  
Use 3/4 cup of brown sugar and eliminate granulated white sugar for cookies that are more chewy.
