### Ingredients  

- 1 cup (225 g) butter, melted
- 3 cups (600 g) white sugar
- 1 tablespoon (15 mL) vanilla extract
- 4 eggs (add one more for a cakier result)
- 1 1/2 cups (180 g) all-purpose flour
- 1 cup (70 g) unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda (to give them a nice crust - omit if you don't want that)
- 6 oz chopped semisweet chocolate or 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips (180 g)
- 1/4 cup water
 
### Instructions  
  


1. Preheat oven to 350<span style="font-size: 10.5px; line-height: 0; position: relative; vertical-align: baseline; top: -0.5em;">o</span>F (175<span style="font-size: 10.5px; line-height: 0; position: relative; vertical-align: baseline; top: -0.5em;">o</span> C).
2. Whisk flour and cocoa together with baking soda and salt, set aside
3. Melt butter in the microwave or on the stovetop.
4. Combine the melted butter, sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl. Mix
5. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each, until thoroughly blended.
6. Gradually stir in the flour and cocoa mixture on low speed.
7. Toss the chocolate chips in a light dusting of flour, and stir into the mix with a spoon or spatula. The flour will keep them suspended in the batter and prevent them from all sinking to the bottom!
8. Pour into prepared pan.
9. Spread the batter in the pan, slightly mounding on the sides so it will all bake evenly (avoiding the typical mound you get in the middle after baking).
10. Bake for 35-40 minutes.
