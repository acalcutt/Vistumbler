      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This spot looks like it could be the origin of many fish stories judging by the number fisherman generally here on the weekends.  Since I am not a fisherman, any fish story that I would attempt to tell would be quite lame.  But, did I ever tell you about the one armed fisherman….?  

Cache is a small camouflaged container with room for small trade items.  Contains log book, LED light for FTF, themed TB, and several other trade items.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Our family went to this park several years ago as part of an afternoon drive.  The children enjoyed playing on the playground equipment and walking around the lake.  The walk around the lake forever traumatized the children and renamed the park for our family.

Halfway around the lake we observed several boys throwing rocks at the helpless ducks.  Now every time we pass by the park on the way to the coast, we are reminded that we are passing the park “Where Boys Are Mean To Ducks.”

No Parking Signs line the Highway 33 side of park, so use the parking lot.  Posted signs also state that park closes at 10PM.  Bring your own pen or pencil.</groundspeak:long_description>

My wife reminds me that I'm incorrect all the time, but thankfully I listened to the checker as well as I listen to my wife and went after it anyways.  Not sure what I did wrong.  I tried it 10 times and I've had good luck with these checkers before.  

Found the cache anywho, and we had to use a skill that Sesame Street taught me many (many,many,many) years ago.  Which one of these...  When we realized we found it we had to wait out a couple of yapping muggles so we went and had lunch.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="RED"&gt;Cache is not at the posted coordinates unless
you like living in the fast lane.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The cache itself is on property with permission. Busy at times,
so watch for mugglers.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;An interesting thought with foreign languages is
that people sometimes believe using either an electronic or
software translator they can understand anything spoken in other
languages. In trying this you will sometimes get some really funny
words in place of what should be there. In reality, most if not all
languages are interpreted, that is, a sentence or statement is
taken in by the interpreter and an equivalent sentence or statement
is spoken to the other person(s) that has a very close if not exact
meaning. It is more difficult to interpret abstract ideas or
describe something that “is like…”, because a word that we
understand as something very exact may not have an equivalent in
the other language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Idioms are another type of statement or label that
all languages have that are hard to interpret since they are very
historical, cultural or relational in nature and what is
interpreted may be correct, but in most cases the actual meaning is
lost. Without the background material, the meaning to what is
spoken may not make any sense of any sort. For example, “no
brainer” just does not interpret well and this is from a real
situation that I was present at in Russia. The interpreter’s
response was “huh, I don’t understand that”, so they tried another
idiom with a similar response and until, finally they said “that it
does not take much education to understand”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Over a five year period I have been to Russia,
Germany, Mexico and El Salvador and before traveling to those
countries I have tried to learn some of the basics of each
language, but even then, it is difficult. Worst yet, is if you
speak anything in their language, they believe that you can speak
fluently in their language, this is especially true if you tell
them that you don’t understand in their own language. They just try
explaining themselves differently or louder, thinking you are hard
of hearing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If you have been in a situation talking to someone
who is obviously foreign and is struggling with our language you
will notice something that shows how they have learned our
language. When they are trying to translate in their mind what you
just said or visa-versa, trying to translate what they want to say
in to our language. There is this long pause as they construct
their sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The best way to learn a new language is done by
being immersed in the culture and learn just like you did as a
small child. Seeing objects named and then used in sentences that
show simple use of those objects, eventually more words are added
as descriptors like verbs, adjectives and nouns, alone with gender
and tense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You may have heard someone speaking and some words
are missing out of their sentences, words which we have in our
language, but they are not in other languages. Other languages are
less verbose; take the simple word "and" for example, is not in
some languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Some languages word position is not really important
and does not change the meaning of the sentence and ometimes
position is used is in setting importance, Greek and Russian are a
couple of those languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Here are some simple statements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Ik wil de drie schotels voor zeven platen
ruilen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Je veux deux vestes et cinq pantaloons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Er lebt nahe zwei zwei acht lubard Strasse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Tutto, ascolta! Uno di due articoli che desidero,
solo uno è il colore correttto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Eu comprei cinco cãse e dois deles são fêmeas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cinco de las siete tiendas aquil son ceros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring a pen to sign the log. That should almost be a given for
any cacher since I have heard some interesting ways to sign a log
without and some of the writing implements that are supplied
sometimes don't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;There is some foreign money for the first to find.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replaced cache with new container in a close spot&lt;br /&gt;

I tried to without success to find this cache over a year ago and somehow never made it back.  Today was the day for another look.  It is a pretty cool hide.  The inside was wet and some of the names have washed off of the log but it is really not in bad shape.  I patted the log dry on my pants but it isn't completely dry.  I didn't want to smear the names.  Thanks for the fun!

Waypoint 1 is a Nano. Sorry, but now that just about everybody has found some of these, it should be pretty easy (if all else fails, use the hint). You should have no problems with muggles either.

The note inside will lead you to waypoint 2.

Waypoint 2 is a EASY Micro. You do need to watch for muggles here though. Please replace it carefully so it isn't too easily visible.

Happy caching.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I was particulary saddened by the May 2007 Griffith Park fire,especially because I was planning a new series of caches here.  Now, two months later, some of the roads are opening, but not all of the hiking trails are available, which also means there are not as many caches.  I'm placing this cache to hopefully help the "repopulation" of Caches in the park.

There are a few ways to get to this cache, but the best way I found, is to use the Bronson Gate Entrance and head east up the fireroad towards "Batman's Batcave" (GC8413).  

The terrain is loose, but climbable if you take your time.

Once you reach the cache, you can caaarrrrreeeefully go back the same way, or continue onwards for a nice walk, in a counterclockwise direction, along the fireroads  which will bring you back down again, past "Cub Scout 351" (GCCB31), "Bronson Falls" ( GC10KTM), and "Slumbo's Broken Heart" (GCG9Z6).

*NOTE: I placed this cache without encountering any blocked roads, but as I continued ONTO the fireroads at the top,  there were some plastic barriers, but saw no signs about trespassing.  Also,  a park ranger passed by me in his truck, waved, but didn't say anything. Still, use your best judgement.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was our first Geocache ever!  We live right near Griffith Park and decided to finally take advantage of the GPS feature of my iPhone, and do some Geocaching.  We parked near the Observatory and hiked along the fire road, to the trail.  The iPhone's GPS isn't 100% accurate (only pinpoints to around 100 feet) so it took some searching, but we finally found it!  We signed the log, but decided not to take or add anything, just to get a feel for the kinds of things people leave.

Coming off our high of our first find, we hiked towards the Batman Cave cache... only to realize GPS doesn't account for crazy differences in altitude -- what was supposedly 200 feet away was actually a big cliff down... but I'll log our adventures of that on the Batman Cave cache...

As foon mentioned, since i hadn't really read the cache page too closely, i attempted a new route to this one. And was successful! It's definitely the easiest way to get to this cache at only 1.2mi round trip on large fire roads. After this we were at something like 6.7 miles for the day and starting to get tired! Good thing the weather was mostly cool today.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">My 11th find today while hiking in Hollywood with BenH57.  We drove along the roads and got to within 400' of the cache.  Too steep of a climb, BenH57 said.  He wanted to approach this from the top, and he knew from where we had to start.  Ok, so we head toward there, but the road is closed.  Darn!  Now what?  Park the car and walk, of course - we're geocachers! [:P]  We started walking, and I was dubious about our approach.  After a while, even BenH57 was dubious.  However, as usual, BenH57 always finds the best way, and we ended up on a trail about 40' from the cache.  And, we only had to climb an easy little hill.  FYI: we parked at N 34 07.415, W 118 18.155 and walked 1.2 miles round trip.  I highly recommend this approach if your car is nearby.  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is one in a series of caches dedicated to showing where
the shore for the Auburn Lake would be if the dam were built. The
surface of the lake would be 1,100 ft in elevation, from the
overlook in Auburn to many miles up both the middle and north forks
of the American River canyon. 
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, there are MANY areas caches in this series can
be placed. Which is why I'm inviting any cachers who would like, to
join me and place caches in this series. Make sure it's within
&lt;a rel="nofollow" href=
"http://www.aboutlaketahoe.com/hiking/topo-maps/pages/auburn-dam-full.htm"&gt;
The Lake's&lt;/a&gt; area, and that it's close to 1,100 ft. I am allowing
myself and others +/- 100 vertical feet due to the fact that good
cache locations can sometimes be hard to find. If you choose to
place one for this series, please email me a day or two in advance
and I'll let you know which number yours will be, which should help
avoid duplicates. Just name your cache "Shoreline #x" where x would
be the next number in the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to ClipperCreekWanderer, Species5618, and Warriorrider
this is the thirteenth in the series, and it's at 1,156 ft, across
the lake from Auburn. Perfect spot for another grand lakeshore
casino, sprawling over acres of land, no?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is #13, to help dispell any unlucky visits to it I
asked for it to be published on 7/7/07 - the luckiest day in a long
time, and a good thing to see on the slot machine you're playing -
and I've included a genuine lucky horseshoe. Please keep it in the
cache, unless you replace it with another good luck item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've found "Above No Hands Bridge" then you know what the
trail is like. It's a shorter distance if you come up from the
bridge, but more elevation gain and a very steep trail compared to
coming from CCL, which is a longer hike, but less elevation and not
so steep. You decide!&lt;/p&gt;

Awesome, caching in Auburn!!  After dropping The Bosss off for her class I took my kids, Thing One of Two and Thing Two of Two out for a day of hiking and caching in the area.  “We” decided to tackle one of the hardest trails in the Auburn State Recreation.  You will notice the quotation marks around the “We”.  After an incredibly hard six hour hike and caching, the boys and I picked up The Bosss from her class and headed up to Grass Valley.  I went to the geocache event that night while my wife and kids visited with family.  Overall a great day, fun caches, an event and visiting with family.

My Stats for the day:  27 finds, a day with my boys, event with Geo friends, visit with family and finished off Survivor Sacramento!!

About this cache:  Found on the way up the hill... huff... huff... That is quite a trail.  Cache was in sad shape as it had been crushed by a fallen tree!!  After signing the log I reshaped the container to make it waterproof again.  It should be serviceable for another winter.</groundspeak:text>

I have one daughter and she is engaged.  The wedding takes place the first week of August 2007.  Since the engagement was first announced, I have had really just one job.  Writing Checks!  Finally, I have a real job.  On Sunday July 8 there was a wedding shower for my daughter strictly a girls affair.  So it is my job to keep all the guys busy; What to do?

Yep a geocache hunt!  At first I was going to use existing caches, then I decided I wanted to put stuff in the caches for them to find.  The geocaching community gets the benefit of this expensive adventure.  This is a series of 5 caches, some of which were stocked with goodies that would not be allowed in a regular cache (stuff like bubble gum and those little cap like popper goodies, that stuff will all be gone before they are published and replaced with regular ordinary stuff.

When you see this cache published the shower will be over and the contents in perfect shape ready for the first to find to grab.  There will be an unactivated geocoin for each "2nd To Find" in the series of 5.  But . . . no more than one to a person, so it will then go to the 3nd to find and so on. . . . . If you are 2nd to find, send me an email with your address and I will post a coin to you. (I figure being first to find is it's own reward.)

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">A quick and easy one. This airport was built in 1940 and served as an auxiliary glider airport during World War II. Today you can observe different types of aircraft at this county airport, ranging from gliders to small passenger planes to a Rockwell Aero Commander. This airport is also home to the 29 Palms Soaring Club. 

The original tetrahedron, or wind indicator, from Condor Field (at 29 Palms Marine Base) which was used from 1942 to 1944 is now at this airport. It was given to the airport in 1983 by the Marine Corps Base in quite a dilapidated condition and has since been restored for use.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Gram Parsons was a country rock musician who loved the desert and spent a lot of time in Joshua Tree. He often stayed at the Joshua Tree Inn, room 8, just west of the cache. He spent so much time partying there he ended up dying of a massive drug overdose in room 8 on September 19,1973. His manager and friend Phil Kaufman had made a death pact with Parsons, agreeing to cremate him in the desert. He rented a hearse, and with the help of the driver traveled to LAX and stole the body of Gram Parsons, drove it to Joshua Tree National Park, and cremated it on Cap Rock. Kaufman and his accomplice were arrested; however, there were no laws on the books against theft of a dead body or public creamation, so the pair were released. This became a bit of a folk tale, so much so that a movie was made about the incident called "Grand Theft Parsons." It's really campy and very bad but you can Netflix it if you like.

The cache is easily accessed if you park in the Hi Desert Cultural Center lot. Cache is in the crook of the tree trunk across from room 8.</groundspeak:long_description>

I set this container on 8/27/08. I had let some FTF opportunities pass because I was certain that no one else would hike to them. That hesitation lost me three FTF's to Ron Fisk, my friendly FTF opponent.

Then when I got home, I accidentally erased the coordinates for the cache. Many times I could have hiked out here to get them, but didn't. Then the Moose set a cache 345 feet away, so I lost again.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Here is the deal!

I have one daughter and she is engaged.  The wedding takes place the first week of August 2007.  Since the engagement was first announced, I have had really just one job.  Writing Checks!  Finally, I have a real job.  On Sunday July 8 there was a wedding shower for my daughter strictly a girls affair.  So it is my job to keep all the guys busy; What to do?

Yep a geocache hunt!  At first I was going to use existing caches, then I decided I wanted to put stuff in the caches for them to find.  The geocaching community gets the benefit of this expensive adventure.  This is a series of 5 caches, some of which were stocked with goodies that would not be allowed in a regular cache (stuff like bubble gum and those little cap like popper goodies, that stuff will all be gone before they are published and replaced with regular ordinary stuff.

When you see this cache published the shower will be over and the contents in perfect shape ready for the first to find to grab.  There will be an unactivated geocoin for each "2nd To Find" in the series of 5.  But . . . no more than one to a person, so it will then go to the 3nd to find and so on. . . . . If you are 2nd to find, send me an email with your address and I will post a coin to you. (I figure being first to find is it's own reward.)</groundspeak:long_description>

After losing everything in a wind storm his pardners tried starting a badger farm near here. They thought there would be a market in pet badgers until one night an angry crowd of locals showed up on their door step shouting "Badgers! Badgers! We don't need no stinking badgers!" I think that was Sarah Madre's family.

Actually the area around here is fun to drive around in and the houses are interesting to look at. Plus there are other caches to grab near here too.

There were so many people walking up and down the hill, that I decided to just bypass this one, with the intention of trying for it on the way out. 
But I came out a VERY different way so didn't get the 2nd chance. 
It's a BEAUTIFUL area to hike, and the history is very interesting. I'll make my way back someday to further explore the ruins and try for the caches I missed/DNF'd today.

 This site is part of the longest, oldest, most successful bluebird
trail in Riverside County. Bluebirds are cavity nesters on the
decline due to loss of nesting sites. volunteers hang nestboxes and
in this area have fledged hundreds of baby Western Bluebirds. Keep
watching for bluebirds and others in the area. If you'd like to
report your bird sightings go to &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=

     align="right" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="5" /&gt;This cache
     is a tribute to those among us who often show an amazing
     tenacity in their searches. Cachers often overcome difficult
     hides, long treks, contacts with unfriendly animals, reptiles
     and insects, inclement weather and even risks to health and
     limb to complete their quest. Their stories are the fodder for
     caching legends, to be told around the campfire at caching
     events!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following excerpts are from the June 16, 2007 log of
&lt;a rel="nofollow"

&lt;b&gt;&lt;a title="New York/New Jersey Multi-State Multi-Cache"
href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GC3CBF"&gt;New
York/New Jersey Multi-State Multi-Cache&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The cache carries
a warning that it is not a "cache and dash" since it is a
challenging hike, and is in a hunting area. (Quote used with
permission):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"…..Let's just say that both of us are no strangers to long
hours and difficult hikes but this trail was more challenging in
some ways than we had imagined. While up there, there were storm
clouds and thunder rumbles and we were blessed with only a few
light showers but needless to say this made the going a little
trickier with the ROCKS and rocky trail (with moss and lichen on
it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…..We had wrongly assumed that "it's only 10 miles" and we'll be
in and out ….. in a couple hours. 8 + hours later we were nearly
limping down...I say that because I managed to get my foot caught
and took a spill, flying several feet and "impaling" my knee on a
small but very sharp rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…..That was about the time the rain droplets were falling and
everyone else was skeedaddling down off the mountain but us. &lt;b&gt;We
were on a mission and I was not going back without this
cache.&lt;/b&gt;"&amp;nbsp; (Close quote)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache at hand is not about a long trek or a meeting with a
mountain lion.&amp;nbsp; But remember, you are always &lt;b&gt;On a
Mission!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

And i also hugged, rubbed and kissed another girl for the first time while married ty wife. This special girls name was EMMA. and i have posted an image of the girl and i face to face. My wife understood when she saw the pictures, she told me that she wouldn't expect me to fight off a temptation that strong and be succesfull. 

EMMA is the most adorable Saint Bernard i have ever seen. if you look at the picture you can see that her head is four times the size of mine and she could simply put my hole head in her mouth with room for another. this dog was so sweet and friendly I was sad when the owner had to take her on her way.  I will never forget this cache or EMMA.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache was placed on the 4th of July, 2007 at a spot where a mudslide made its way down to the Sourgrass area on January 1, 1997. As of right now, the area is recovering nicely with a nice variety of trees that were planted almost 10 years ago.
We parked at the road turn-off here and walked in about 75 yards before accessing the cache site. Feel free to cut cross-country earlier but there will be bushwacking!
Note: This seems to be an active logging road so park OFF the road. Those airhorns can be loud! 
If you're interested in the sheer magnitude of this mudslide, drive down Boards Crossing Road out of Dorrington until you get down to the river. There's a beam of the
old bridge embedded in the bank a ways down from the new bridge site. There are also a few caches placed down there! 
Also, depending on the snow cover in the winter, this cache might be more difficult to find. 

Congratulations to Troll #5 for being first to find!</groundspeak:long_description>

You will need to take the trailhead to Gaylor Lakes, but the cache is not inside the park.  Wear good hiking boots and bring enough water.

I thought I would be the first one to 'open' the season, but it seems someone else had logged in the journal their trip up on June 17, 2008!  I am impressed!!  There was still quite a bit of snow up there even today (I can only imagine how much snow must have been up there two weeks ago)!!

I replaced the old container with a much sturdier box that should withstand many sierra winters.  I added some more new socks and my 4 year old son donated one of his hotwheels.

If you plan to visit the cache soon please bring LOTS OF BUG SPRAY and SUNBLOCK!  The worst mosquito areas are by the lakes.  Also please remember to be careful of the mine shafts in the area.

Happy Caching!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was reviewing my "caches for the year" today.  I can't believe that I have/did not log this one.  We spend a month at Lundy every year and this was to be the "big find" for '08.  We tried earlier in the month, but there was too much snow to even get started.  Returned on the 17th, and though we had to take a variation of the trail in several places, we perservered.  Thank you so much to the owner for reminding me to log and for placing the cache in a sturdier container.  I loved the Great Mine, and we were sooooo tempted to go down the Bennetville route, there was just too much snow for us "old" folks.  Thanks for the cache and the challenge!!</groundspeak:text>

Maybe next time [:)] Anyway, thanks a lot for giving me another reason to come here! Cache is in good shape and ready for winter...</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Here is the deal!

I have one daughter and she is engaged.  The wedding takes place the first week of August 2007.  Since the engagement was first announced, I have had really just one job.  Writing Checks!  Finally, I have a real job.  On Sunday July 8 there was a wedding shower for my daughter strictly a girls affair.  So it is my job to keep all the guys busy; What to do?

Yep a geocache hunt!  At first I was going to use existing caches, then I decided I wanted to put stuff in the caches for them to find.  The geocaching community gets the benefit of this expensive adventure.  This is a series of 5 caches, some of which were stocked with goodies that would not be allowed in a regular cache (stuff like bubble gum and those little cap like popper goodies, that stuff will all be gone before they are published and replaced with regular ordinary stuff.

When you see this cache published the shower will be over and the contents in perfect shape ready for the first to find to grab.  There will be an unactivated geocoin for each "2nd To Find" in the series of 5.  But . . . no more than one to a person, so it will then go to the 3nd to find and so on. . . . . If you are 2nd to find, send me an email with your address and I will post a coin to you. (I figure being first to find is it's own reward.)</groundspeak:long_description>

There are some great views and great things to see in this park and this cache will help you get started on your trip.

There is no need to leave the trail for this one, but you will have to stretch a bit. Please make sure it can't be seen when you replace it.

Initial items are a strong hard drive magnet, a small luggage lock, and my very first FIMO token. There is a log book, but no pen. Please bring your own.</groundspeak:long_description>

After placing it and having it rejected because of proximity, I've been keeping my eye on the space to see if it would open up.  And it finally did.  So here's another contribution to the IH caches.  

The cache is a small mint tin container with room for the log and extremely small trade items.

There's no need to climb on the overpass</groundspeak:long_description>

find the actual coordinates of the cache, you must solve the
following puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This puzzle is anything but child's play, but I remember working
on it when I was 12 or 13 years old. I cannot remember if I ever
solved it then or at any other time in my life, so I gave it a try
and spent an hour solving it. Not bad for someone with a college
degree in a history. If I can solve it, so can you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a micro that is carefully hidden where playing
children are not likely to find it. To find it, you'll need to use
the digits found in the following cryptogram multiplication problem
to determine the coordinates of the cache. Each letter represents a
different digit between 0 and 9 inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

For the past fifty years, The Chronicles of Narnia have transcended the fantasy genre to become classic literature. This is the seventh and last puzzle based on one of these books. First you have to determine which book and then figure out how to get the coordinates from the material presented. Have fun and I hope you’ll read some of the stories. They’re really quite good.


BEGIN PUZZLE

By Caldron Pool;
. . . he was the cleverest, ugliest, most wrinkled ape . . .;
And he called out, “Aslan! Aslan! Aslan! come and help us now.”;
“What will happen if we get killed here?”;
“People shouldn’t call for demons unless they really mean what they say.”;
Almost at once there was a bump . . . and two children were standing before him;
“It can’t be true.  Aslan would never sell us into slavery” . . .;
“Come and try on your beautiful new lionskin coat,” said Shift.;

“Ape,” he cried with a loud voice, “you lie.”;
“He was very fed up with the stable and quite ready to come,”;
“ . . . who has called on gods he does not believe in.  How will it be with him if they have really come?”;
The lion skin had got pretty untidy already during Puzzle’s long imprisonment . . .;
“Who goes there?” shouted the king. “Me, Poggin the Drawf.”;
“Speak, if you’re not a phantom or a dream.  You have a Narnian look about you . . . “;

Wilderness Park Cache&lt;/a&gt;, which has since been archived because it
burned up in a fire a couple of years ago.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">It was March, 2001 when I first heard about Geocaching.
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/log/36148cdb-d303-4b4b-878d-ca07e2638e8b.jpg"
     align="left" /&gt;I was in a Where's George? chat room and my
     friend &lt;a rel="nofollow"
     href="http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=a4e0cce3-dfeb-4e67-9d12-0f5cff29f2da&amp;amp;wid=546f3b82-1226-46fd-b8d6-354f1f21dfee&amp;amp;ds=2"&gt;
Seamus&lt;/a&gt; was discussing his latest cache find that he'd just
found in Maryland. I asked him what this was all about and he
showed me the site. 
&lt;p&gt;While I was looking over Geocaching.com, he came back and told
me he'd already done a search for all the caches nearest to my
house. The closest cache was &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;7 miles away, and a half mile
hike&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, hence the name of this cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course at that time, there weren't too many micros - small
caches were about the tiniest anyone wanted to hide back then - and
most, if not all caches at the time were hidden along trails in the
foothills. I lived in Rancho Cucamonga at the time and I had caches
showing up on my first page of closest caches that were over by JPL
in Pasadena and down in Orange County. Most were upwards of two
mile hikes one way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, by the time I was done looking over the Geocaching site,
I figured I might as well try this out. Since my birthday had just
passed and I hadn't told my wife what I wanted yet, I decided right
then that I &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;needed&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; a GPSr. This was a Tuesday. On
Thursday, I had purchased a Garmin 12, and on Saturday March 10th,
2001 I registered at Geocaching and hauled the boys out of the
house, drove the 7 miles, then hiked the half mile to the cache
site. In the back of my mind I kept thinking to myself, "Self, this
is nuts. You're going to get caught on Candid Camera and make
yourself look like a fool in the process." Well, Candid Camera
never materialized, but a large, black painted bucket did. I was
hooked and my youngest son is also hooked as well. This cache
commemorates our first find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hike is about a half mile in along the Cobol Canyon trail.
There will be some bushwhacking over the last 50 feet or so to get
to ground zero. As always, watch for poison oak, but I didn't
notice any in the immediate search area.&lt;/p&gt;
